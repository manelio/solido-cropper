Viewport

Control Box

Each layer has its own transformation matrix
A layer can be attached to a transformation driver (a object that handles pan, zoom and scale transformations)

There are 'modes'. Behavior of the onPointerStart event depends on mode.


Constructor:

    if param is a image, replace image by the viewport
    if param is a string, it's the image id
    else, param should be an object

        container
        image


    new Gear()
    new Layer('image')
    new Layer('overlay')

    humblecropper.layer();
